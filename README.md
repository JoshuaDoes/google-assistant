### A Google Assistant library written in Go

----

This README will be updated with proper instructions at a later date once it is ready for a full release.

Logic based on similar work by [mattetti](https://github.com/mattetti) for [ok-go](https://github.com/mattetti/ok-go), for which this library would not exist without.

If you understand Go and you understand how the Google Assistant SDK works, you shouldn't need to wait for my blessing of this repository to start having fun!
